### About the Project

This project would be based on the delivery of the first nanodegree project ReactJS - MyReads


Some of the key principles applied:

* Use reusable, state-less functional components such as Book and BookShelf
* Use state components in order to keep track of which shelf a book is on
* Use ReactRouter to allow a user to navigate the web app
